# Media Upload System - Blinders Secure Chat

## Overview

The Blinders Secure Chat application now includes a comprehensive media upload system with cloud storage, virus scanning, and advanced security features. This guide covers the implementation, usage, and administration of the media upload functionality.

## Features

## Chat Integration

### Media Messages
When files are uploaded through the chat interface, they are automatically sent as special media messages:

```json
{
  "type": "media",
  "content": "ðŸ“Ž filename.jpg",
  "mediaUrl": "https://cloudinary.com/...",
  "mediaType": "image",
  "mediaId": "64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0"
}
```

### Chat Interface Integration
- **Upload Button**: Paperclip icon in chat input opens upload panel
- **Gallery Button**: Image icon opens media gallery for the current room
- **Media Rendering**: Uploaded media is displayed inline in chat messages

## Database Schema

### Media Model
```javascript
{
  filename: String,           // Cloudinary filename
  originalName: String,       // Original filename
  mimeType: String,          // File MIME type
  size: Number,              // File size in bytes
  url: String,               // Cloudinary URL
  cloudinaryId: String,      // Cloudinary public ID
  uploadedBy: ObjectId,      // User who uploaded
  roomId: ObjectId,          // Associated room (optional)
  mediaType: String,         // image, video, audio, document, other
  isPublic: Boolean,         // Public access flag
  scanStatus: String,        // clean, infected, pending, error
  scanResults: Object,       // Scan results object
  tags: [String],           // File tags
  downloadCount: Number,     // Download counter
  lastAccessed: Date,       // Last access timestamp
  metadata: {
    width: Number,           // Image/video width
    height: Number,          // Image/video height
    format: String           // File format
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Environment Variables

npm install cloudinary multer-storage-cloudinary

# Frontend dependencies are already included
```

### 2. Configure Cloudinary
1. Create a Cloudinary account at https://cloudinary.com

## Usage Guide

### For Regular Users

#### Uploading Files in Chat
1. Open a chat room
2. Click the paperclip icon in the message input
3. Drag and drop files or click "browse" to select files
4. Files are automatically validated and uploaded
5. Media messages appear in the chat

#### Viewing Media Gallery
1. Click the image icon in the chat interface
2. Browse uploaded files for the current room
3. Use filters to find specific file types
4. Click on any file to view details

### For President Users

#### Media Management Dashboard
1. Click the user menu in the header
2. Select "Media Management"
3. View system statistics and recent uploads
4. Use advanced filters to find specific files
5. Perform bulk operations like virus scanning

#### Security Monitoring
- Monitor scan status of all uploaded files
- View file access patterns and download counts
- Delete infected or inappropriate files
- Track storage usage and file types

## Security Considerations

### File Validation
- All files are validated by MIME type and size
- Malicious file extensions are blocked
- File content is scanned for viruses (simulated)

### Access Control
- Users can only access files they uploaded or files in rooms they have access to
- President users have full access to all files
- Public files can be accessed by any authenticated user

### Storage Security
- Files are stored on Cloudinary with secure URLs
- Original filenames are preserved but stored filenames are randomized
- File metadata includes security scan results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Upload Fails
- Check file size limits
- Verify Cloudinary configuration
- Ensure user has proper permissions
- Check network connectivity

#### Files Not Displaying
- Verify Cloudinary URLs are accessible
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure proper authentication tokens

#### Virus Scan Issues
- Current implementation uses simulated scanning
- Integrate with real antivirus service for production
- Check scan status in media management dashboard

### Error Codes
- `400`: Bad request (invalid file, size limit exceeded)
- `401`: Unauthorized (invalid token)
- `403`: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404`: File not found
- `500`: Server error (Cloudinary issues, database errors)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real antivirus integration (ClamAV, VirusTotal)
- File compression and optimization
- Advanced media processing (thumbnails, transcoding)
- Bulk upload operations
- File sharing links with expiration
- Advanced analytics and reporting

### Performance Optimizations
- CDN integration for faster delivery
- Image optimization and resizing
- Lazy loading for media galleries
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed files
